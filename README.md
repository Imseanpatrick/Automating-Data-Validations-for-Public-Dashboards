# Automating Data Validations for Public Dashboards

This project aims to automate data validation processes for the Cross-Tracking System of State and County Correctional Populations in Massachusetts. By leveraging Python functions, I transformed an intensive weekly validation process that originally took 8 hours into an efficient 5-minute task.

The [Cross-Tracking System](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/cross-tracking-system-state-county-correctional-populations) is designed to provide comprehensive tracking of correctional populations across the state and county levels. Ensuring the accuracy of the data is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system and supporting informed decision-making. The main objectives of this project included automating the data validation process to reduce manual effort and time, enhancing the accuracy of data presented in public dashboards, and streamlining the workflow for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security's Data Management team.

To achieve these objectives, I worked with the team to understand the current validation process and identify areas for improvement. I then developed a series of Python functions that automate data transformations and validations, which were implemented to replace the manual validation efforts. I then trained the full time Analyst on this program. As a result, the validation time was reduced from 8 hours to just 5 minutes per week, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the data validation process. This automation allowed team members to focus on more critical tasks rather than spending extensive time on repetitive validations.
